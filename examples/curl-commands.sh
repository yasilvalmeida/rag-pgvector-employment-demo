    "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is another important area of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.",

They are essential for modern AI applications, especially those involving similarity search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). pgvector is a PostgreSQL extension that adds vector similarity search capabilities to PostgreSQL. It supports exact and approximate nearest neighbor search with different distance functions including L2 distance, inner product, and cosine distance.",
